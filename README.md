# Secfi Back-End Assignment TypeScript

The idea is to create a microservice that allows CRUD operations on a “users” table. The service should allow read and write operations following this interface:

```
interface IUser {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    userName: string;
    password: string;
    avatar: string;
}
```

<ul>
    <li> Service runs in a Docker container </li>
    <li> Passwords are stored in encrypted format </li>
    <li> Avatars are also stored </li>
</ul>

## Prerequisites

```
Install Node.js first. Built with latest version
```
